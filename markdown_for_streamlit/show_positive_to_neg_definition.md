**Adopting the Positive-to-Negative Points Ratio:**

- **Mitigating Enrollment-Length Confounds:**
  The Positive-to-Negative Points Ratio addresses the impact of new students, providing a nuanced perspective beyond the constraints of traditional magnitude-based assessments. This metric unfolds a richer narrative, offering insights into performance dynamics, behavioral patterns, and challenges that transcend numerical values.
  
Example Cases:
1. **Student A: Positive-to-Negative Points Ratio = 5**
   - This suggests that Student A accumulates five times more positive points than negative points. It indicates a consistent trend of strong performance and a resilient approach to setbacks.

2. **Student B: Positive-to-Negative Points Ratio = 1**
   - In this case, Student B accumulates an equal number of positive and negative points. The ratio of 1 implies a balanced distribution between achievements and setbacks, showcasing a mixed pattern of performance.

3. **Student C: Positive-to-Negative Points Ratio = 0.7**
   - With a ratio of 0.7, Student C has a slightly lower proportion of positive points compared to negative points. This may suggest areas of struggle or challenges that warrant closer attention or intervention.

These examples demonstrate how the Positive-to-Negative Points Ratio provides a quick, intuitive way to gauge the balance between positive and negative point accumulation for each student, offering insights into performance trends and potential areas of concern.
